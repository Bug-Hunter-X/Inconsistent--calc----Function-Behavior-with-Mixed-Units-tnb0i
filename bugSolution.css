To resolve this issue, it's best to avoid mixing percentage and pixel units within the `calc()` function. A more robust approach uses a consistent unit, thereby ensuring predictable results across different browsers. If possible, either use only percentage units or only pixel units in the calculation.

Here's an example using only percentage units:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(50% + 5%);
}
```

Or, using only pixel units:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(500px + 10px);
}
```

This avoids potential inconsistencies caused by browser-specific interpretations of mixed unit calculations.
